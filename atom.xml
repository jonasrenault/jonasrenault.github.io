<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p><img src="http://jonasrenault.github.io/images/food/Fresh-Herbs.jpg" title="Basil" alt="Basil" />
<img src="http://jonasrenault.github.io/images/food/Tomatoes-1.jpg" title="Optional Tomatoes" alt="Tomatoes" /></p>

<h4>For the pesto</h4>

<ul>
<li>1 bunch (approx 1 cup) fresh basil</li>
<li>1 large garlic clove, chopped</li>
<li>3 tablespoons chopped toasted walnuts or pinenuts</li>
<li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>&frac12; cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
</ul>


<p>If you want to spice it up a little bit, you can also add</p>

<ul>
<li>A few sprigs of mint or parsley</li>
<li>1 ripe avocado</li>
</ul>


<p>Combine the herbs, garlic, nuts, lemon juice and cheese in a food processor. Blend it and slowly pour in some oil. How much oil is up to you, depending
on how thick you want your pesto to be. I went with 3-4 tablespoons. Add salt and black pepper to taste.</p>

<h4>For the salad</h4>

<ul>
<li>300g short pasta</li>
<li>1 can(150g) green peas</li>
<li>200g cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
</ul>


<p>Heat up the green peas and cook the pasta in boiling water until al dente. Drain both when ready. Mix in the pesto with the still hot pasta to release
the flavors from the basil and garlic. Then mix in the peas and the tomatoes. You can serve it hot or put it in the fridge to cool.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, my friend. You want to get yourself a beautiful blog like mine ? Well, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.
I&rsquo;m going to show you how to set up your very own blog. Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;ll be quick and painless so read on.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I recently decided to get myself one of those personal blogs that everyone seems to have nowadays. You know the type. On the front page there&rsquo;s always
a header saying &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m Jonas and this is my blog&rdquo;. Followed by a few links to the usual suspects twitter, github and co. And then some posts, more
or less recent and more or less interesting. It&rsquo;s the minimum to have if you want to pass off as a decent developer.</p>

<p>So I went around shopping for some neat blogging frameworks and came back with this beautiful baby. Under the hood, it&rsquo;s running on Octopress. What is Octopress you ask ? In the very own words of it&rsquo;s creator, Octopress is an obsessively designed
framework for Jekyll blogging. Itâ€™s easy to configure and easy to deploy. Sweet huh?</p>

<hr />

<p>Here are just a few sweet points about Octopress :</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s built for developers. So you&rsquo;re in familiar territory, right ? That means you use git to clone your new project, save your changes and deploy your blog.
The site&rsquo;s template is all HTML, CSS and javascript. If you want to get in there and build your own lean, mean killing machine, nothing&rsquo;s going to get
 in your way. The posts content is all in Markdown, nothing new to you either. Basically, you&rsquo;ll feel right at home and blogging will be just like working on any other project.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very fast to setup. It&rsquo;s one of those &ldquo;opinionated&rdquo; frameworks that makes some good choices for you so you can focus on the important stuff but
lets you change it later if that&rsquo;s what you want. Nice !</p>

<p>Deploying your blog is super easy. If you deploy to Github Pages or Heroku, one command will simply push everything to your remote repository and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>

<p>So, what do you think ? You&rsquo;re ready to get your own ? I&rsquo;ll just send you <a href="http://octopress.org/">there</a> then. Just follow the instructions, read the documentation and in 10 minutes
you&rsquo;ll be good to go.</p>

<p>Yes, it does come with some custom themes that you can choose. Have a look <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">here</a>.
Mine&rsquo;s adapted from <a href="https://github.com/sevenadrian/MediumFox">MediumFox</a>. It&rsquo;s not the cleanest code in my opinion so I tweaked a few things here and there
to get what I wanted.</p>
