    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, my friend. You want to get yourself a beautiful blog like mine ? Well, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.
I&rsquo;m going to show you how to set up your very own blog. Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;ll be quick and painless so read on.</p>

<p>I recently decided to get myself one of those personal blogs that everyone seems to have nowadays. You know the type. On the front page there&rsquo;s always
a header saying &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m Jonas and this is my blog&rdquo;. Followed by a few links to the usual suspects twitter, github and co. And then some posts, more
or less recent and more or less interesting. It&rsquo;s the minimum to have if you want to pass off as a decent developer.</p>

<p>So I went around shopping for some neat blogging frameworks and came back with this beautiful baby. Under the hood, it&rsquo;s running on Octopress. What is Octopress you ask ? In the very own words of it&rsquo;s creator, Octopress is an obsessively designed
framework for Jekyll blogging. Itâ€™s easy to configure and easy to deploy. Sweet huh?</p>

<hr />

<p>Here are just a few sweet points about Octopress :</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s built for developers. So you&rsquo;re in familiar territory, right ? That means you use git to clone your new project, save your changes and deploy your blog.
The site&rsquo;s template is all HTML, CSS and javascript. If you want to get in there and build your own lean, mean killing machine, nothing&rsquo;s going to get
 in your way. The posts content is all in Markdown, nothing new to you either. Basically, you&rsquo;ll feel right at home and blogging will be just like working on any other project.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very fast to setup. It&rsquo;s one of those &ldquo;opinionated&rdquo; frameworks that makes some good choices for you so you can focus on the important stuff but
lets you change it later if that&rsquo;s what you want. Nice !</p>

<p>Deploying your blog is super easy. If you deploy to Github Pages or Heroku, one command will simply push everything to your remote repository and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>

<p>So, what do you think ? You&rsquo;re ready to get your own ? I&rsquo;ll just send you <a href="http://octopress.org/">there</a> then. Just follow the instructions, read the documentation and in 10 minutes
you&rsquo;ll be good to go.</p>

<p>Yes, it does come with some custom themes that you can choose. Have a look <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">here</a>.
Mine&rsquo;s adapted from <a href="https://github.com/sevenadrian/MediumFox">MediumFox</a>. It&rsquo;s not the cleanest code in my opinion so I tweaked a few things here and there
to get what I wanted.</p>
