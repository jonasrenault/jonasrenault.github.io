Hi! I'm a senior research engineer and fullstack developer, with master's degrees in applied mathematics, computer science and artificial intelligence. I specialize in developing data analysis & visualization tools as well as AI / ML models, mostly with Python and JavaScript frameworks. My areas of expertise also include databases, data processing tools, cloud computing and DevOps.

I have fifteen years of experience working as a software engineer, and for the past ten years Iâ€™ve been contributing to open-source projects while working as a research engineer at [Inria](https://inria.fr/en), France's national institute for research in digital science and technology. I have an interest for public service and projects that tackle current social and political problems through the development of human-focused software and AI models.

I enjoy working with multidisciplinary teams from various backgrounds. I have experience working with small, agile teams of engineers to deliver software that is problem oriented and reliable. Recently, I've been taking on the role of project manager and leading engineering teams, focusing on ways to get higher impact engineering organizations.

Please take a look at [some of my work](/work).

Here is my [resume](/assets/files/cv-jrenault-2022.pdf) (in french).

Please contact me with any questions (email on the left).
