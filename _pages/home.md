Hi! I'm a senior research engineer and fullstack developer, with master's degrees in applied mathematics, computer science and artificial intelligence. I specialize in developing data analysis and visualization tools, mostly with Python and JavaScript frameworks.

I have twelve years of experience working as a software developer, and for the past six years Iâ€™ve been contributing to open-source projects while working as a research engineer for French research institutes (CNRS, INRIA). I have an interest for public service and projects that tackle current social and political problems through the development of human-focused software, data analysis and visualization.

I enjoy working with multidisciplinary teams from various backgrounds. I have experience working with small, agile teams to deliver software that is problem oriented and reliable. I am an independent engineer and I value initiative, knowledge sharing, good coding practices.

Please take a look at [some of my work](/work).

Here is my [resume](/files/cv-jrenault-2022.pdf) (in french).

Please contact me with any questions (email on the left).
