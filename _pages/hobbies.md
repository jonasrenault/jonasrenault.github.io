Besides my work, I have a keen interest for philosophy. I obtained a master's degre in philosophy in 2020, and this has helped me to broaden my horizons and to be able to communicate better with the people I work with. I specialize in contemporary political philosophy, critical social theory, as well as problems about subject and body in feminist philosophy.

On my spare time, I sometimes like to draw; I obtained a bachelor's of visual arts in 2018. I also like to [read a lot](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91507153-jonas-renault).

I enjoy traveling to forein countries. I've lived abroad for a few years already, and I speak english fluently.
