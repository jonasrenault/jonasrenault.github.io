**Project manager for Defense & Security research**, *INRIA* <span class="pull-right">2023 - </span>  
<span class="small-grey"><i class="fas fa-tools" aria-hidden="true"></i> Python, Machine learning, JavaScript, Docker</span>  
Project manager for [INRIA's Defense and Security](https://www.inria.fr/fr/mission-securite-defense-bilan-frederique-segond) mission. I am in charge of the engineering aspects for the various projects lead by the D&S team, whose goal is to develop partnerships and research initiatives with entities working in the field of national defense and security (Defense ministry, gendarmerie, etc.). As a project manager, I supervise engineers working on projects that develop state of the art AI research for military and defense appplications, and I contribute to developments of algorithms, tools and web platforms. I also help deploy, maintain and transfer ownership of those projects to our partners.

Research engineer, within the INRIA PARIETAL team, in charge of the [NeuroLang](https://neurolang.github.io/) project. NeuroLang is a probabilist query system for meta-analysis of neurological studies. NeuroLang implements a Datalog query solver to interpret and solve relational algebra queries on large neuroimaging datasets. I worked on NeuroLang to optimize the query solver and to develop a web application for the project.

Research engineer within the CNRS, in charge of the [Cartolabe](https://cartolabe.fr/) project. The Cartolabe web application lets users explore large collections of textual data through an interactive 2D map. AI algorithms analyze the textual data to produce a 2D representation of the corpus showing semantic similarities. It uses advanced visualization techniques to rapidly display millions of points in the browser and allow users to search, filter and zoom through the data.
